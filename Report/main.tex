\section{Abstract}
The advancement of technology has led us to both new opportunities and challenges. One of the major challenges is ensuring safety in our homes and workplaces. Fire alarms play a crucial role in alerting us to potential fire hazards, allowing us to take necessary precautions. In this project, we have designed a fire alarm system using a flame sensor, a BC557 transistor, and a buzzer. The flame sensor detects the presence of fire by sensing the infrared light emitted by flames, while the BC557 transistor amplifies the signal from the flame sensor to trigger an alarm and activate a buzzer when a fire is detected. The buzzer provides an audible alert, ensuring immediate attention. The system is designed to be cost-effective and easy to maintain, making it accessible to a wide range of users. The results obtained from both simulation and practical implementation show that the fire alarm system is reliable and efficient in detecting fire hazards, providing an effective solution for enhancing safety in various settings.

\section{Introduction}

In the age of technology, safety is of utmost importance. Fire alarms play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of individuals and property. In this project, we have designed a fire alarm system using a flame sensor, a BC557 transistor, and a buzzer. The flame sensor detects the presence of fire by sensing the infrared light emitted by flames. The BC557 transistor is used to amplify the signal from the flame sensor and trigger an alarm and activate a buzzer when a fire is detected. The buzzer provides an audible warning, making the system more effective in alerting people to fire hazards.

The main objective of this project is to create a reliable and efficient fire alarm system that can be easily implemented in homes, offices, and other buildings. The system is designed to be cost-effective and easy to maintain, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

Several projects have been developed under this topic for constructing a fire alarm system using different components. A fire alarm circuit has been done on detecting forest fires by optimally placing the fire sensors, which reduces interference. The report proposes optimal placement of the fire detection sensors based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio criterion. The proposed approach is analytically evaluated, and the results show that the throughput is 53.28\% compared to the random deployment of sensors, where the throughput is 45.21\% [1]. Another work has been proposed on designing of a voltage tunable dual band Ge-on-Si photodector combining wavelength sensitive detection with classification algorithms.The  evaluation and its performance against various interference sources, by exploiting machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Quadratic SVM, has achieved up to 99.8\% classification accuracy [2]. There is a report on proposal of how to reduce false alarms on benign flames using 3D CNNs. The study primarily relies on how bright illumination or presence red colored objects can cause false alarms. By the application FalseNet, a new video dataset, consisting of both real and fires and common false-positive sources.Paired with a 3D ResNet+(2+1)D CNN using CBAM attention, it achieves 90.44\% accuracy by better distinguishing benign flames from actual fire hazards in CCTV footage. Grad-CAM confirms the model focuses on correct spatial features [3]. Another project focuses on a rTPNN (Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network) which is a novel multi-sensor fire detection model that predicts both sensor level and trend patterns using recurrent processing, which achieves 96\% accuracy, outperforms LSTM/SVM/MLP (both TP/TN $>92\%$), and triggers alarms in 11s (vs 22s for others). Ideal for real-time fire detection [4].
A Privacy-Preserving Iot-Based Fire Detector proposes on a privacy preserving IoT fire detection system which extracts video data from raw footage and sends to the cloud for analysis,achieving 97.5\% accuracy using binary video descriptors + CNN. Outperforms raw video methods while protecting privacy. Runs real-time on Raspberry Pi 4 (100\,ms/frame) [5].

In this paper, we will discuss about the design of the fire alarm system, by the use of a flame sensor and a BC557 transistor. The discussion will include the working principle of the components used, the results obtained and future scope of this project. The results are both simulated in TinkerCAD, (a simulation program by Anydesk) and practically implemented in the Laboratory.

\section{Detailed Description}
The fire alarm system is a simple electronic circuit designed to detect the presence of fire and provide both visual and audible alerts. It uses a flame sensor to detect infrared radiation emitted by flames, a BC557 transistor as a switch, an LED for visual indication, and a buzzer for audible alert. When the flame sensor detects fire, it sends a signal to the BC557 transistor, which then activates the LED and buzzer.

The flowchart in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart} outlines the operation of the fire alarm system. The process begins with powering on the circuit. The flame sensor continuously monitors for the presence of fire. If no fire is detected, the system remains in a standby state. When the flame sensor detects fire, it sends a signal to the BC557 transistor, which then allows current to flow to the LED and buzzer. The LED turns on to provide a visual indication of fire detection, while the buzzer emits an audible alert to warn occupants of the potential danger. The system continues to operate until it is manually reset or powered off. This design ensures that the fire alarm system is responsive and effective in alerting individuals to fire hazards, enhancing safety in various settings.

The entire system is designed to be cost-effective and easy to maintain, making it accessible for use in homes, offices, and other buildings. The components used are readily available and the circuit can be easily assembled on a breadboard for testing and implementation.

\section{Results \& Analysis}
By implementing the fire alarm system in both software and hardware, the evaluation of performance is done. The results obtained from the testing phase are analyzed to assess the reliability and effectiveness of the fire alarm system. The key metrics evaluated include the Detection Reliability Index (DRI) and the average distance at which the system can reliably detect fire. The results obtained from the testing are as follows:

\subsection{DRI (Detection Reliability Index)}
The Detection Reliability Index (DRI) is calculated based on the number of successful detections of fire compared to the total number of tests conducted. In testing phase we conducted tests by changing and observed the response of the fire alarm system. The DRI is calculated and plotted in a graph as follows:

	\caption{DRI vs Distance graph}
	\label{fig:dri_distance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Average Distance Analysis}
The average distance at which the fire alarm system can reliably detect fire is calculated based on the results obtained from testing. The average distance is found to be approximately 15 cm, which indicates that the system is effective in detecting fire within a reasonable range. The results are plotted in the graph below:

	\caption{Average Time vs Distance graph}
	\label{fig:avg_distance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
The sensitivity of the fire alarm system is analyzed by adjusting the sensitivity of the flame sensor and observing the response of the system. The system is tested 5 times for $S_1$ = 0.0106 S/cm, $S_2$ = 0.018 S/cm, $S_3$ = 0.0206 S/cm, $S_4$ = 0.0054 S/cm and $S_5$ = 0.0126 S/cmsensitivity levels, \& the average sensitivity is calculated to be approximately 0.01344 S/cm.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the fire alarm system using a flame sensor and a BC557 transistor has been successfully designed, implemented, and tested. The system effectively detects the presence of fire and provides both visual and audible alerts. The results obtained from the testing phase indicate that the system is reliable and efficient in detecting fire hazards within a reasonable range.
